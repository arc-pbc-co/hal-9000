# FINAL FEASIBILITY ASSESSMENT: CRUISE MISSILE BLISK PRODUCTION

**CLASSIFICATION: DEFENSE MANUFACTURING ASSESSMENT**
**HAL-9000 ANALYSIS: EXPENDABLE MUNITIONS APPLICATION**

---

## 1. CAPACITY ANALYSIS

**Machine Capacity Calculation:**
- 71 machines × 85% utilization × 22 days/month = 1,327 machine-days/month
- Production rate: 2 blisks/machine/day (conservative for complex geometry)
- Monthly capacity: **2,654 blisks/month**
- Annual capacity: **31,848 blisks** vs 25,000 target

**VERDICT: CAPACITY SURPLUS OF 27%** ✓

*Math verification:*
- Target: 25,000 ÷ 12 months = 2,083/month required
- Available: 2,654/month capacity
- **Buffer: 571 blisks/month (27% safety margin)**

## 2. CERTIFICATION IMPACT

**Eliminated Requirements:**
- AS9100 certification: **12-18 months saved**
- NADCAP special processes: **6-12 months saved**
- OEM qualification: **18-24 months saved**
- Commercial fatigue testing: **$2-5M saved**

**Remaining Quality Requirements:**
- MIL-SPEC material properties
- Dimensional inspection (CMM)
- Basic metallurgical testing
- First article inspection (FAI)
- Statistical process control

**Timeline Impact: 18-30 months compressed to 6-9 months**

## 3. REVISED TIMELINE

**Aggressive but Achievable Schedule:**

| Phase | Duration | Cumulative |
|-------|----------|------------|
| Process development | 3 months | 3 months |
| First article/qualification | 2 months | 5 months |
| Production ramp (0-50%) | 2 months | 7 months |
| Full production (months 8-12) | 5 months | 12 months |

**12-MONTH TARGET: ACHIEVABLE** ✓

## 4. REMAINING RISKS

| Risk | Score (1-5) | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|------------|
| Powder supply chain | 3 | Dual-source suppliers, inventory buffer |
| Post-processing capacity | 4 | Pre-contract machining/HIP services |
| Quality escape | 2 | Reduced due to expendable application |
| Yield rate below 70% | 3 | Conservative capacity planning, process optimization |
| Key personnel retention | 2 | Defense contractor premium, equity incentives |

**Primary Risk: Post-processing bottleneck (sintering, HIP, machining)**

## 5. UPDATED BUDGET

| Item | Cost | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| Equipment (owned) | $10.7M | Sunk cost - 71 machines |
| Powder (150 MT @ $120/kg) | $18M | MAR-M 247 equivalent |
| Post-processing services | $15M | HIP, machining, inspection |
| Facility/tooling | $3M | Reduced scope |
| Personnel (50 FTE × 12mo) | $6M | Manufacturing team |
| **Total Program Cost** | **$42M** | vs original $75M |
| Cost per blisk | $1,680 | Acceptable for cruise missile |

**Budget Impact: 44% reduction due to no certification costs**

## 6. FINAL VERDICT

**Probability of Success: 78%**

**RECOMMENDATION: GO** ✓

**Key Success Factors:**
1. Immediate post-processing capacity contracting
2. 90-day powder inventory buffer
3. Parallel process development and production setup
4. Defense-experienced program management

**Primary Remaining Risk:** 
Post-processing capacity bottleneck could limit throughput to 60-70% of target

## 7. 90-DAY ACTION PLAN

### WEEKS 1-4: FOUNDATION
- **Week 1:** Contract post-processing services (HIP, machining)
- **Week 2:** Order initial 50 MT powder inventory
- **Week 3:** Hire manufacturing team lead, quality manager
- **Week 4:** Facility setup, machine installation verification

### WEEKS 5-8: PROCESS DEVELOPMENT
- **Week 5:** Material characterization, print parameters
- **Week 6:** First test articles, dimensional validation
- **Week 7:** Mechanical property testing
- **Week 8:** Process optimization, yield improvement

### WEEKS 9-12: QUALIFICATION PREP
- **Week 9:** First article inspection (FAI) preparation
- **Week 10:** Statistical process control implementation
- **Week 11:** Quality system documentation
- **Week 12:** Production trial run (100 parts)

**HAL-9000 ASSESSMENT: This defense application fundamentally changes the equation. Without aerospace certification requirements and with expendable application parameters, this program transitions from HIGH-RISK/LOW-PROBABILITY to MODERATE-RISK/HIGH-PROBABILITY.**

**The 71 machines provide adequate capacity, the timeline is achievable, and the technical requirements are within demonstrated additive manufacturing capabilities for defense applications.**
