## 1. EQUIPMENT CAPACITY ANALYSIS

### Theoretical Throughput Calculations

**Per Machine Analysis:**
- Typical MBJ build volume: ~300mm × 200mm × 200mm
- Blisk dimensions: 200mm diameter × ~80mm height
- **Parts per build**: 1 blisk per machine per cycle (due to diameter constraints)
- Build time: 12-16 hours + 4-8 hours handling = **20-24 hours total cycle**

**Fleet Capacity:**
- 71 machines × 1 part per cycle = **71 blisks per cycle**
- Cycle time: 22 hours average
- **Daily theoretical capacity**: 71 × (24÷22) = **77 blisks/day**
- **Monthly theoretical capacity**: 77 × 30 = **2,310 blisks/month**

**Realistic Throughput (85% utilization):**
- Accounting for maintenance, changeovers, yield losses
- **Realistic monthly capacity**: 2,310 × 0.85 = **1,964 blisks/month**
- **Annual capacity**: 1,964 × 12 = **23,568 blisks/year**

### CAPACITY GAP ANALYSIS
- **Required**: 40,000 blisks/year
- **Available**: 23,568 blisks/year
- **Shortfall**: 16,432 blisks/year (41% gap)

**Additional machines needed**: 16,432 ÷ 332 = **49 additional machines**
**Total fleet requirement**: 120 machines (71 acquired + 49 needed)

### Downstream Equipment Requirements
- **Debinding furnaces**: 12-15 units ($200K each)
- **Sintering furnaces**: 8-10 units ($500K each)  
- **HIP units**: 4-6 units ($2M each)
- **Machining centers**: 20-25 units ($300K each)

## 2. POWDER SUPPLY REASSESSMENT

### Global Capacity vs Requirement

**240 MT Requirement Analysis:**
- Current global MBJ powder capacity: ~500-800 MT/year
- Program requirement: 240 MT (30-48% of global capacity)
- **SIGNIFICANTLY MORE FEASIBLE** than original 1,200 MT

**Qualified Suppliers:**
- **Carpenter Additive**: 150-200 MT/year capacity
- **Höganäs**: 100-150 MT/year capacity  
- **LPW Technology**: 50-100 MT/year capacity
- **AP&C (GE Additive)**: 80-120 MT/year capacity

**Supply Strategy:**
- Lock long-term contracts with 2-3 suppliers
- 50% from Carpenter, 30% from Höganäs, 20% contingency
- 12-month forward contracts at premium pricing

**Supply Chain Risk Score: 3/5** (DOWN from 5/5)
- Manageable with proper contracting
- Still requires 6-12 months advance planning

## 4. UPDATED RISK MATRIX

| Risk Category | Original Score | Revised Score | Change | Notes |
|---------------|----------------|---------------|--------|-------|
| **Equipment Availability** | 5/5 | 2/5 | ↓↓↓ | 71 machines secured, 49 more needed |
| **Capital Requirements** | 5/5 | 3/5 | ↓↓ | 43% cost reduction, still substantial |
| **Powder Supply** | 5/5 | 3/5 | ↓↓ | Manageable volume, but tight market |
| **Technical Feasibility** | 4/5 | 4/5 | → | Unchanged - still major development |
| **Manufacturing Readiness** | 5/5 | 4/5 | ↓ | Equipment in hand accelerates timeline |

### To Reach >80% Success Probability:
1. Reduce target volume to 25,000 blisks (match current capacity)
2. Extend timeline to 18-24 months
3. Partner with aerospace OEM as co-developer
4. Establish backup supply chains for all materials

## 7. RECOMMENDED PATH FORWARD

### **CONDITIONAL GO RECOMMENDATION**

The dramatically improved equipment position transforms this from "nearly impossible" to "highly challenging but potentially achievable."

### Critical Path - First 90 Days:

**Week 1-2: Immediate Actions**
- Audit all 71 machines (condition, capabilities, spares)
- Initiate powder supplier negotiations (long-term contracts)
- Begin facility planning for 120-machine operation

**Week 3-8: Foundation Building**
- Launch process development program (partner with universities)
- Initiate discussions with aerospace OEMs for qualification pathway
- Begin recruitment of MBJ specialists globally
- Secure additional machine acquisitions (target 30 units by Month 6)

**Week 9-12: Validation Phase**
- First blisk prototypes from acquired machines
- Material characterization and property validation
- Downstream process development (debinding/sintering)

### Decision Gates:

**Month 3**: Process feasibility demonstration
- Success: Continue with full facility build-out
- Failure: Pivot to reduced scope or exit

**Month 6**: Production rate validation
- Target: 100 blisks/month sustained rate
- Success: Proceed to full production
- Failure: Reassess volume targets

**Month 12**: Quality validation
- Target: Aerospace-grade properties achieved
- Success: Scale to full production
- Failure: Extended development timeline

### Contingency Triggers:
- **If powder supply constrained**: Develop alternative materials
- **If additional machines unavailable**: Reduce volume targets
- **If quality targets missed**: Extend timeline to 24 months

**BOTTOM LINE**: With 71 machines in hand and reduced powder requirements, this program shifts from "nearly impossible" to "extremely challenging but potentially achievable." The key enabler is the massive head start on equipment availability. Success probability jumps from ~5% to 35-40% with proper execution.
