# Phase 2: Skill System - Progress Log

## Codebase Patterns

- Skills are stateless - all state in Session
- Tools return AsyncGenerator[dict, None] for streaming
- Use existing RLM processor for Claude API calls
- Reuse code from ingest/, acquisition/, categorize/, obsidian/ modules
- ADAMPrompt must include all required fields for platform consumption
